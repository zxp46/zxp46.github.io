DAC: A Double Accelerating Contrastive Learning Framework
======
Combining Masked Image Modeling with Contrastive Learning by proposing a new data augmentation method and an assymetric architecture for Contrastive Learning. Both modifications help achieve better performance within faster training time compared to previous methods. Achieved SOTA level results on image classification. 

*Jan 2022 ~ Apr 2022*

FAD: Feature Alignment Discriminator for Abstractive Text Summarization
======
Tackling the discrete nature of GAN in NLP with feature matching discriminator. The discriminator is applied at finetuning stage for text summarization, where real/fake samples are from generated/reference summaries. Achieved better ROGUE score than BART only.

*Feb 2022 ~ Apr 2022*
