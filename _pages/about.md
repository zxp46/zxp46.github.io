I'm Zixuan Pan, an ECE master student at University of Michigan, advised by Professor **[Andrew Owens](https://andrewowens.com/)**.

I got my CSE B.Eng from University of Michigan as well as ECE B.Eng degree from Shanghai Jiaotong University, where I was fortunate to work with Professor **[Kai Yu](https://x-lance.sjtu.edu.cn/en/members/kai_yu)**.

My research interests are mainly focused on **unsupervised learning**, with the aim to explore the potential of unlabeled data.
