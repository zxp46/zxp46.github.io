I'm Zixuan Pan, a senior Computer Science student at University of Michigan, advised by Professor **[Andrew Owens](https://andrewowens.com/)**.

I'm also an undergrad at Shanghai Jiaotong University, major in Electrical and Computer Engineering (receiving dual Bachelor degree), where I was advised by Professor **[Kai Yu](https://x-lance.sjtu.edu.cn/en/members/kai_yu)**.

My research interests are mainly focused on generative modelling and unsupervised learning, with the aim to explore the potential of unlabeled data. My research domain primarily lies in computer vision, but I believe the intuition and math foundations behind the ideas can be spread to other aspects of machine learning.
